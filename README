---------
OVERVIEW
Repository contains the data and code required to generate one figure from our project, 
which is the analysis of conserved sequences present in transition metal ion transporters 
for the E. coli Nissle genome. Figure shows the percentage of A, T, G, and C in the E. coli 
Nissle genome.


---------
DATA
Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (E. coli) complete genome, including sequence and features in a
RefSeq Genomic GenBank format (.gbff) file. Annotation was added by the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome 
Annotation Pipeline (released 2013). Publicly available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000714595.1#/def
